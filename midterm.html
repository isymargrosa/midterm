			<p>Although not all of them were a part of the original group, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Abstract" target="_blank">Kevin Abstract</a>, Ameer Vann, Joba, Matt Champion, and Merlyn Wood met as teenagers, as they all attended The Woodlands High School in The Woodlands, Texas.[15] In 2010, Abstract made a post[16] on the KanyeLive online forum (now known as KanyeToThe) asking if anyone wanted to form a band, to which over 30 users responded. After this AliveSinceForever was then formed, although the band only went active in 2012. In 2013, AliveSinceForever released their debut EP album, The ASF EP.[17] The lineup consisted of Abstract, Vann, Dom McLennon, and Mic Kurb (later known as Rodney Tenor). At the end of 2014, AliveSinceForever disbanded to rebrand as Brockhampton.[18][19]</p>

			<h2 class="h2ading" id="2018-anchor"><b>2018–2019: Ameer Vann's departure, Iridescence and Ginger</b></h2>

			<p>In March 2018, Brockhampton announced that Team Effort had been delayed indefinitely, and that they would instead release their fourth studio album Puppy in mid-2018.[44] The next week, they announced via social media that they had signed a record deal with Sony's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_Records" target="_blank">RCA Records</a>.[45] Billboard reported that according to label sources, the deal was worth more than $15 million for six albums over three years.[46]</p>

			<p>Puppy was delayed following allegations of sexual misconduct against founding member Ameer Vann. Although Vann admitted to being mentally and verbally abusive, he denied allegations of sexual abuse.[47][48] On May 27, Brockhampton announced that Vann would no longer be a part of the group, stating that they "were lied to" and apologizing "for not speaking up sooner". The group canceled the remainder of their tour dates, including an appearance at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governors_Ball_Music_Festival" target="_blank">Governors Ball Music Festival</a>.[49]</p>

			<p>On June 20, the band appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, in their late night television debut, and their first performance since announcing Vann's departure.[50] They debuted the track "Tonya", accompanied by guest vocalists Jazmine Sullivan, Ryan Beatty and Serpentwithfeet, as well as revealing the new title of their upcoming album, The Best Years of Our Lives.[51] Following the performance the band resumed their summer tour, headlining the Agenda Festival in Long Beach, California.[52] The next month the group announced a Beats 1 radio show Things We Lost in the Fire Radio, promising "new music all summer".[53] The show's first episode was aired on July 6, 2018, featuring the debut of single "1999 Wildfire", released that day with an accompanying music video. The track features vocals by Jazze Pha.[54] On July 18, the single "1998 Truman" was debuted as a part of the show's second episode. A music video for the track was released later that day.[55] On July 27, the group released the single "1997 Diana", accompanied by a music video. Later that day the song was featured on the third episode of Things We Lost in the Fire Radio, alongside the unfinished track "Don't Be Famous".[56] On August 26, 2018, the group announced that a new album titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence_(album)" target="_blank"><i>Iridescence</i></a>, recorded in Abbey Road Studios, would be released in September.[57] The band also announced dates of their "i'll be there" tour, which began on October 3, 2018 in Mesa, Arizona, concluding on December 6, 2018 in Las Vegas, Nevada.[58] Iridescence was officially released on September 21, consisting of fifteen new songs, including the revamped version of "Tonya" without Sullivan and Beatty, who lent vocals during the debut performance of the song four months earlier. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 on September 30, 2018, becoming Brockhampton's first chart-topping album.[59] In January 2019, the band received their first ever nomination for the "Best International Group" at the BRIT Awards, which took place at The O2 Arena on February 20, 2019.[60]</p>
